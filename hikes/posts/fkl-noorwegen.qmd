# Finnskogleden

The Finnskogleden is a long-distance trail on the border between Norway and Sweden. Its by far the most amazing hike we ever did! Highly recommended, but make sure you are prepared because its relatively remote and you won't find any supermarkets on the route. But if you want peace and quiet, this is the hike to do, on our 11 days of hiking, we encoutered only about 6 other hikers. 

There is some (partially oudated) information on the Finnskogleden[website](https://finnskogleden.com), otherwise feel free to message me for info.
