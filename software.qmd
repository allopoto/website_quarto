      title: "InstaGibbs"
      description: "The aim of instagibbs is to rapidly and easily obtain Linderstrøm-Lang ΔG and ΔΔG values from HDX-MS data both at the peptide and residue level. 

      The web interface pulls published HDX-MS datasets from a database and can be accessed and visualized directly as peptide, residue and protein structure representations."

      title: "PyHDX"
      description: "PyHDX is used to analyize HDX-MS datasets and express them as residue-level Gibbs free energies. Deuterium uptake kinetics are described as a single fit parameter per-residue using a PyTorch optimizer and the Linderstrøm-Lang model of Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange. The project features an interactive web interface where users can upload, analyze and visualize their data."
